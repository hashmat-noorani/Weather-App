Weather App that displays the weather wherever the user happened to be. I implemented the following user stories:

- Users can view the weather in his/her current location
- Users can search for weather information of other places also
- The weather icon will change depending on weather conditions
- Weekly, daily, and hourly weather reports
- Data on humidity, feels like, as well as the current time of location
- Built-in map allowing users to monitor the weather in a particular region
